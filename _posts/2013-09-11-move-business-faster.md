We can't show you absolutely *all* the ways our customers use KISSmetrics to be successful, but we can point you in the right direction. Check out:

**[KISSmetrics Demo Account][demo]**

See how a business might set up its different *reports* (Metrics, Funnels, Cohort Reports, and People Searches). Go ahead and click on each tab to see the different types of reports. You can switch the demo to look at reports for different business types:

* Subscription-based
* E-commerce
* A Mobile App

The question you should consider is this:

**What Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are important for you to be tracking right now?**

If you're a total beginner, our successful customers use KISSmetrics to analyze *revenue*, *A/B test experiments*, and *ad campaigns or other URL-tagged marketing channels*. There are also blog links below to help give you some ideas.
