summary: Import your existing Recurly transaction data into KISSmetrics.
---
If you have been using [Recurly][recurly] to track [**transactions**][transactions], you can now import event data about the people who purchased or refunded.

*We have not yet added support for tracking* ***subscriptions*** *but may plan to in the future. Please let us know if you are interested in this integration!*

## Integration Details

#### Identities

* Users will be identified by the *email address* that is tied to the transaction in Recurly.

#### Events

* `Billed`. Alternatively, if you've [mapped a different event to our "Billed" event][mapping], we'll use this event from your mappings.
* `Refunded`.

#### Properties

* `Billing Amount`. Alternatively, if you've [mapped a different property to our "Revenue" property][mapping], we'll use this property instead.
	* *Positive* amounts are used for successful transactions (`Billed` events)
	* *Negative* amounts are used for successful refunds (`Refunded` events)

#### Frequency of Import

* We will only import successful purchase transactions.
* Test transactions are omitted.
* We will import historic transaction data from the last 3 years.
* We will check every hour for new transactions.
