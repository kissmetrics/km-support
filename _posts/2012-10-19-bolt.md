## What is BO.LT?

[BO.LT][about] is a platform for sharing pages on the Web that you like. With BO.LT you can instantly save that page, share it with others, put it in a gallery that others can see, or just keep it for yourself for later.

But it's more than a sharing service. You can easily customize your saved pages (known as your "BO.LTs"). You can make modifications to the original page and save these as your personalized _variations_ to the original page. You can even configure a single BO.LT URL to show a different variation of your saved page, depending on where your visitors came from:

1. Visitors coming from Facebook
2. Visitors coming from Twitter
3. Visitors coming from Google
4. Mobile visitors

It's easy to manage your different page variations within the BO.LT dashboard.

## I don't use BO.LT. What do I need to know as a KISSmetrics customer?

When someone saves a page on your site to their BO.LT account, a copy of your page is preserved, KISSmetrics script and all. When a visitor follows the BO.LT URL to your page, most likely they will trigger the `Visited Site` event, along with its corresponding properties `Referrer` and `URL`.

The BO.LT integration will also automatically record two properties to indicate more information about the BO.LT page:

* `Viewed Bolt` : last part of the BO.LT URL.
* `Bolt Variation` : which variation was viewed (the BO.LT user will name these variations)

## I use BO.LT. What more can I do with it as a KISSmetrics customer?

In your [BO.LT settings][bolt-settings], you have the option to Enable KISSmetrics as an Analytics Tag. 

![Using Bolt 1][ssuse1]

When you enter your existing KISSmetrics [API key](misc/api-key) into this field, BO.LT will place the KISSmetrics tracking script on all pages you share through BO.LT. This allows you to track within KISSmetrics how many visitors are coming to the BO.LTs you share. If the page you are sharing already has our JavaScript on it, your API key will take precedence.

Visitors to your BO.LTs will trigger an event `Viewed Bolt - xxxxx`, and the variation of which page they saw will also be recorded as the property `Bolt Variation`.
