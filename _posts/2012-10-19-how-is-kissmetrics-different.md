## KISSmetrics is the only analytics platform that measures at the person level.

Other analytics packages measure based on pageviews, or isolated events. That means they’ll tell you how many times a page was accessed, or how many times an event was performed. But they won’t tell you who your customer is, or how they’re using your site.

KISSmetrics tracks every single time a visitor comes to your website, even before they are a customer, and ties that anonymous activity to them once they do actually turn into a customer. This allows you to understand where they came from, what they did, and what ultimately led them to become a customer.

After they’ve become your customer, KISSmetrics continues to keep track of their activity and lets you see how valuable they are to you.

You can also connect any number of properties to a person. Tell KISSmetrics one time that your new customer, Joe Smith, is a designer, used a 20% off coupon, was referred by a friend, and works in a startup — we’ll remember it forever.

You can use that in the future to slice your data and understand usage patterns, assess marketing campaign effectiveness, and segment your customers.

You can create reports on the fly. KISSmetrics doesn’t require you to pre-define your reports. Just track the significant events that happen on your site, and we’ll collect the data.

(You can use KISSmetrics Live to see events being tracked on your site in real-time; it’s a great way to immediately validate that you’ve set up your tracking correctly.)

You can create ad-hoc reports in seconds. We’ll immediately backfill it with your data. No more waiting 24 hours for an empty report to start collecting data.
