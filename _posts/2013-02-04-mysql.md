summary: Connect your MySQL database to KISSmetrics to record events using SQL queries.
permalink: /integrations/mysql/index.html
---
You can connect KISSmetrics to your MySQL database. This will import all existing data and then continuously monitor your database for any new data and pass that into KISSmetrics. This is a powerful and easy way to integrate KISSmetrics with your app.

If you have a non-MySQL database (Oracle, Postgres, SQLite, Mongo), we have not yet built support to directly read from these database types. Let us know that you are interested in seeing such an integration! In the meantime, please consider converting your data into `.csv` files and using our [recurring CSV import][csv] method.

[csv]: /integrations/csv-import

It's recommended you read [@getting-started/people-events-properties] before getting started here.

## Setting up your database

The KISSmetrics SQL integration will only work with a **read-only** database. We enforce this for all users for our users peace of mind. Additionally we recommend that you create a separate MySQL user for KISSmetrics to use. The following SQL will accomplish this:

{% highlight mysql %}
CREATE USER 'kissmetrics'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'some_password';
GRANT select ON your_database.* TO 'kissmetrics'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
{% endhighlight %}

Just make sure you note the username (`kissmetrics` in this example) and password (`some_password` in this example) because you'll need those when you create the connection

## Updating your firewall rules

KISSmetrics will connect to your MySQL server using one of the following IP addresses:

* `75.101.132.88`
* `75.101.161.87`
* `75.101.165.228`
* `184.73.221.24`
* `174.129.16.231`

You'll want to make sure that your firewall allows connections to the port you run MySQL on (which by default is `3306`) from these IP addresses. If you have other security needs please contact support so that we can help you figure out the best solution for your situation.

If your database is hosted on Amazon, then we would be locating your databases using the internal Amazon network. In that case, KISSmetrics will connect to your MySQL server using one of the following internal Amazon IP addresses:

* `10.42.139.187` (Please note, this IP changed November 19th 2012 from the old IP of `10.251.243.191`.  Please update your access control.)
* `10.10.63.120`
* `10.187.169.236` (Please note, this IP changed November 1st 2012 from the old IP of `10.204.37.116`.  Please update your access control.)


## Creating the connection

To create the connection:

* Go to [*Settings*][1] (the small gear tab)
* Click [*External Data Sync*][2]
* Click *Add a MySQL Data Source*
* Fill out the connection details you used in the previous step. You'll need to specify the remote address of the MySQL server. If your server is not accessible over the internet please contact us so we can help you determine your best option.

## Creating queries

You will need to create one query for each event.

* **Name**: you can describe what thie query is importing.
* **Record KISSmetrics Event as**: name the KISSmetrics event that is recorded by this query.

When creating your SQL query you'll need to make sure that the results contain the following fields:

- **`KM_PERSON`** - this field will be used as the identity of the person. Typically you'll want to select the email or username field from your database.
-  **`KM_TIME`** - this field will be used as the timestamp of the event. Typically you'll want to select a date field from your database. 
-  **`KM_LAST_RAN`** - this field is used so that KISSmetrics knows which rows have already been synced. Typically you'll want to select the id or timestamp field from your database.

See below for more details about each.

### KM_PERSON

The value you select for `KM_PERSON` will be used as the identity for the person performing the event. As mentioned the best choice, when available, is the e-mail field form your table. To rename `email` as `KM_PERSON` you can use the `SELECT...AS...` syntax to name the field in the results (e.g. `SELECT email AS KM_PERSON`).

It's possible that the identity field you want to use is in a different table. In this case you might need to use a SQL JOIN to join the two tables. For example if I have a `payments` table that I'm creating a query for I might do:

{% highlight mysql %}
SELECT
  users.email AS KM_TIME...
FROM
  users, payments...
WHERE
  users.id = payments.user_id;
{% endhighlight %}

### KM_TIME

The value you select for `KM_TIME` will be used as the date/time for the event you syncing. KISSmetrics will not sync without this field. The column type can be any valid date field, including just a plain `INT` field with a UNIX epoch-based timestamp. You can use the `SELECT...AS...` syntax to name the field in the results (e.g. `SELECT created_at AS KM_TIME`).

Please note that KISSmetrics will set the timezone to UTC/GMT (`SET time_zone = "+0:00"`) for the connection before making any queries. 

### KM_LAST_RAN


When KISSmetrics syncs it will sync at most 50,000 rows every hour per query. When it runs the next hour it will need to make sure that it selects the next 50,000 rows - making sure not to duplicate or miss any rows.

This is where the `KM_LAST_RAN` field comes in. There are a few key things to keep in mind:

- You need to select a column that only increments when new data is inserted. An ID column is a perfect candidate, because it only goes up (after KISSmetrics has processed the row with ID 500 it knows that no new row with a lower ID than 500 is going to be inserted). A timestamp or date/time column can work also as long as new rows are going to have later timestamps than the existing rows in the database. If users can insert rows with timestamps in the past than a timestamp is not a good choice.
- You need to tell KISSmetrics the last value that was used. You can do this by returning a field with the name `KM_LAST_RAN`. If you were using the `id` column for this purpose you can do `SELECT id AS KM_LAST_RAN` to accomplish this. KISSmetrics will store the last value used here.
- You need to add a condition to your SQL query that will ensure that when KISSmetrics runs your query it only selects rows that have not been synced. The value that you last returned to KISSmetrics will be available in the variable `$KM_LAST_RAN_FOR_THIS_QUERY`. If you are using the ID column you can use `WHERE id > $KM_LAST_RAN_FOR_THIS_QUERY` to accomplish this. You must be **very careful** when using timestamps for the this purpose. To ensure that KISSmetrics does not miss any data it is recommended that you use a `>=` condition (e.g. `WHERE created_at >= $KM_LAST_RAN_FOR_THIS_QUERY`). This does mean that KISSmetrics will get some duplicate rows, but KISSmetrics will ignore the duplicates. Not doing this means that KISSmetrics might miss some data depending on the granularity of your timestamps and the frequency that you get new data.
- Your query will automatically be ordered by `KM_LAST_RAN`. You should not add ORDER BY or LIMIT clauses to your query.

A full query might look like:

{% highlight mysql %}
SELECT
  id AS KM_LAST_RAN
  ...
FROM
  users
WHERE
  id > $KM_LAST_RAN_FOR_THIS_QUERY
{% endhighlight %}

### Additional properties

Any additional fields you return in your SQL will be recorded as KISSmetrics properties for the person/event. So let's say you have `gender` and `country` columns in your table that you want to pass along when a user signs up. You could do:

{% highlight mysql %}
SELECT
  id AS KM_LAST_RAN,
  email AS KM_PERSON,
  created_at AS KM_TIME,
  gender,
  country
FROM
  users
WHERE
  id > $KM_LAST_RAN_FOR_THIS_QUERY
{% endhighlight %}

Whatever the name of the field is is what the property will be recorded as. If you want to use a different name you can use `SELECT ... AS ...`. So if you had a field `cpn` that you wanted to record as `Coupon Code` you could use: `SELECT cpn AS "Coupon Code"`.

## Examples

### Tracking when a user signs up

It's quite easy to track all your signups: 

{% highlight mysql %}
SELECT
  users.login AS KM_PERSON,
  users.created_at AS KM_TIME,
  users.id AS KM_LAST_RAN
FROM
  users
WHERE
  users.id > $KM_LAST_RAN_FOR_THIS_QUERY
{% endhighlight %}
    
Imagine you also have a `payment_plans` table and you want to include the plan name when a user signs up, you can do:

{% highlight mysql %}
SELECT
  users.login AS KM_PERSON,
  users.created_at AS KM_TIME,
  payment_plans.name AS 'Plan Name',
  users.id AS KM_LAST_RAN
FROM
  users, payment_plans
WHERE
  payment_plans.id = users.payment_plan_id AND
  users.id > $KM_LAST_RAN_FOR_THIS_QUERY
{% endhighlight %}

### Tracking when a user pays you

{% highlight mysql %}
SELECT
  users.login AS KM_PERSON,
  payment_transactions.created_at AS KM_TIME,
  payment_transactions.id AS KM_LAST_RAN,
  payment_transactions.amount
FROM
  payment_plans, users
WHERE
  users.id = payment_plans.user_id AND
  payment_plans.id > $KM_LAST_RAN_FOR_THIS_QUERY
{% endhighlight %}

### Tracking when a user cancels their account

{% highlight mysql %}
SELECT
  users.login AS KM_PERSON,
  users.canceled_at AS KM_TIME,
  users.canceled_at AS KM_LAST_RAN
FROM
  users
WHERE
  users.canceled_at IS NOT NULL AND
  users.canceled_at > $KM_LAST_RAN_FOR_THIS_QUERY
{% endhighlight %}
