summary: How to generate a new API key by creating a new site in your KISSmetrics account.
---
You can generate more than one API key for your KISSmetrics account if you're managing different websites, or if you want to keep your testing/development data separate from your production site's data.

## Instructions

1. Click the name of your site in the top-left corner. This shows a menu for all the sites you are managing.
2. Click "Create New Site", and follow our setup process.
