# Takeaways

1. Events represent actions that your customers do.
2. Events can represent *major* actions in the customer's lifetime (`Signed Up`), or more *minor* ones (`Opened an Email`). Google Analytics [refers to these as "macro-conversions" and "micro-conversions"][ga-conversions].
3. Our [Best Practices][best-practices] section has tips on the events you would want to track. Feel free to use it like a checklist, but keep in mind nothing is "required" - you should use KISSmetrics to achieve *your* goals.
4. You'll be customizing your installation to send the events you are interested in.
5. There are [several ways to set up your events][ways-to-send-data]. We will go over the specifics in additional videos.

Common terminology we use for events:

* If `{X}` happened, then trigger an event
* "Fire an event" or "An event was fired"
* "Trigger an event" or "An event is triggered"
* "The event occurred" or "The event happened"

# Exercise

<div class="alert alert-success alert-block">
Determine which event(s) you need for the metric you picked in the last exercise, and when it should occur.
</div>
