summary: Information on other programming languages and 3rd-party libraries.

The following libraries are 3rd-party libraries written by the KISSmetrics community.

<p class="critical">
KISSmetrics does <strong>not</strong> provide official support for these libraries, may not have reviewed them to see if they work, and makes no warranty about them. They are still worth investigating <strong>at your own risk</strong> if your application can't use our official libraries.
</p>

If you have a library you would like to add to this list, you can add it directly [to our Github page][other-github].

The KISSmetrics Tracking API is very simple. Please see [API Specifications][specs] for more information. And if you do write your own, please tell us about it!
