title: Using an A/B Testing Platform
categories: a-b-testing
author: Eric Fung
summary: If you don't want to write any code, you can try a platform like Optimizely, Bo.Lt, Unbounce, or Visual Website Optimizer to set up the A/B test.

There are several platforms that help you manage your A/B tests. They often provide you a WYSIWYG editor for changing your page variations.  They also often let you adjust the weights of the variations: whether you want to split the test 50-50, or 80-20, or 90-10, etc.

We work great with most A/B testing platforms. Generally speaking, you will set up the rules of the test through the platform, and include a small piece of code to record which variation was viewed (the third component to every A/B test).
