When there is no clear winner (results are very close, significance reached), what  do you do? We asked A/B testing experts what they thought and how they operated at their companies.

For an inconclusive test, oftentimes we'll stick to the control if it's a change to something that already exists on the page. If we went with the new variation, at best it will perform the same as the original over a longer period of time, at worst we'd see a decrease in conversions over time. If it's a new addition to the page, we'll be much more open to promoting the variation to production.

## Will Kurt, Data Scientist at KISSmetrics

The big thing to keep in mind with A/B testing is you'll get better results in the long run if you stick with only decision that are clear wins. I would recommend sticking with the original since the uncertainty in the results means you always risk that the other variant is worse. It's a much better use of your time to wait until you've found a really great variant, and not risk too much on variants that are likely to bring you little if any gain.

After 2 weeks I stop the experiment, then I wait another 2 weeks to see the long term effects on metrics like revenue or what plans they are on. Trials for software as a service businesses are anywhere from 2 weeks to 30 days, and I can see what happened as a result of a particular test. I’ll also ask qualitative questions to my team like “what resonated with customers more?” Our sales team has a good beat on this as they are talking with customers every day. Bottom line, I think that when there is no clear winner that you look at how your long term metrics are affected, not just what the experiment was trying to optimize.
